# SpiffUI v3 Components

This folder contains components that were originally in the `packages/spiffui-v3/components` directory and have been integrated into the frontend folder for a cleaner root structure. The original packages folder has been removed.

## Components

- **ProcessInstanceListTable**: A table component for displaying process instances with various filtering and display options.

## Usage

You can import these components using:

```typescript
import { ProcessInstanceListTable } from '../spiffui-v3/components';
```

## Notes

- These components are similar to the ones in the main components folder but may have different URL paths or behavior.
- The spiffui-v3 version of ProcessInstanceListTable uses "/newui/" in the URL paths, while the main version uses standard paths.
